Refer https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/ for basic concepts
2. Docker Engine SDK and API
Docker provides an API for interacting with the Docker daemon (called the Docker Engine API), as well as SDKs for Go and Python. There are unofficial libraries for other programming languages. If you choose to use Java as your programming language, you may use https://github.com/spotify/docker-client. Unofficial libraries don't come with all the features. Some provide control over basic docker engine features only.
The SDKs allow you to build and scale Docker apps and solutions quickly and easily. If Go or Python wonâ€™t work for you, you can use the Docker Engine API directly or any other language third-party SDKs for 
The Docker Engine API is a RESTful API accessed by an HTTP client such as wget or curl, or the HTTP library which is part of most modern programming languages.

5. Google cAdvisor Remote REST API Reference
	1. Pattern of API endpoint
		```
		http://<hostname>:<port>/api/<version>/<request>
		```
		
		The current version of the API is v1.3 and there is a beta release of the v2.0 API
		
    	Supported request types: &quot;containers,docker,events,machine,subcontainers&quot;
		
    	Example: 
		```
		http://localhost:8888/api/v1.3/containers
		```
    	
		The result is returned in JSON format.
		
	2. To get information of all sub containers 
		```
		http://localhost:8888/api/v1.3/subcontainers/
		```
		
	3. To get information of a specific sub container 
		```
		http://localhost:8888/api/v1.3/subcontainers/<subcontainername>
		```
